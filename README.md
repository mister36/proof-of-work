## Description

This is a very basic implementation of a proof-of-work blockchain, written completely in Rust. I decided to build this project so I could get a better understanding of many modern blockchains + cryptocurrencies work. A lot of details are simplified, e.g. blocks store strings instead of transactions, static hash target, etc, but the main principles are still included.

Inspired by Justin Meiner's [article](https://justinmeiners.github.io/tiny-blockchain/).
